The "Seafood CoreML" app is a food recognition project using CoreML, Apple's machine learning framework. It leverages a pre-trained machine learning model to classify seafood items from images taken by the user. The app focuses on image classification, the integration of CoreML models into iOS applications, and working with UIKit to capture and display photos. This project emphasizes the practical use of machine learning on-device and shows how developers can integrate AI into iOS apps.
